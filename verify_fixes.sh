echo "🧪 MANUAL TESTING CHECKLIST:"
echo ""

echo "🔹 TEST 1: Cascade Delete Functionality"
echo "   1. Navigate to Vehicle Management"
echo "   2. Create a test vehicle and assign a device to it"
echo "   3. Go to Device Management" 
echo "   4. Delete the device using swipe gesture or delete button"
echo "   5. Return to Vehicle Management"
echo "   6. Edit the vehicle - device dropdown should work without errors"
echo "   7. Vehicle should show no assigned device"
echo "   ✅ PASS if no crashes or dropdown errors occur"
echo ""

echo "🔹 TEST 2: Device Assignment Logic"
echo "   1. Create multiple vehicles (at least 3)"
echo "   2. Create multiple devices (at least 3)" 
echo "   3. Assign different devices to different vehicles"
echo "   4. Edit a vehicle that has a device assigned"
echo "   5. Check device dropdown shows:"
echo "      - Current device as selected ✓"
echo "      - Unassigned devices as available ✓"
echo "      - Devices assigned to OTHER vehicles as disabled/grayed ✓"
echo "   6. Change dropdown selection"
echo "   7. Verify device is NOT assigned immediately"
echo "   8. Press 'Update' button"
echo "   9. Verify device assignment is saved only then"
echo "   ✅ PASS if device assignment logic works correctly"
echo ""

echo "🔹 TEST 3: Error Handling"
echo "   1. Try to delete a device that's assigned to multiple vehicles"
echo "   2. Verify all vehicle references are cleaned up"
echo "   3. Check that no orphaned references remain"
echo "   ✅ PASS if cascade delete handles multiple references"
