# üì± VEHICLE STATUS FCM NOTIFICATIONS IMPLEMENTATION

## üéØ OVERVIEW

Enhanced the existing vehicle status notification system to send **visible push notifications** to phones, similar to geofence alerts. The system now sends both **notification payload** (visible in notification tray) and **data payload** (for in-app handling).

## ‚úÖ CHANGES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Enhanced Vehicle Status Notifications

**File:** `functions/index.js` - `sendVehicleStatusNotification` function

#### Before (Data-only message):

```javascript
const message = {
  data: {
    /* ... */
  },
  android: { priority: "high" },
  apns: { payload: { aps: { contentAvailable: true } } },
};
```

#### After (Visible notification + data):

```javascript
const message = {
  notification: {
    title: "Vehicle Status Update",
    body: "Beat (BOA7322B2EC4) has been successfully turned on.",
  },
  data: {
    /* complete vehicle status data */
  },
  android: {
    priority: "high",
    notification: {
      icon: "ic_notification",
      color: "#4CAF50", // Green for ON, Red for OFF
      channelId: "vehicle_status_channel",
      defaultSound: true,
      defaultVibrateTimings: true,
    },
  },
  apns: {
    payload: {
      aps: {
        alert: { title: "...", body: "..." },
        sound: "default",
        badge: 1,
        contentAvailable: true,
      },
    },
  },
};
```

### 2. Consistent Geofence Notifications

**File:** `functions/index.js` - `sendGeofenceNotification` function

Enhanced geofence notifications to use the same structure:

- Added `notification` payload for visibility
- Added Android notification styling with colors
- Added iOS alert payload
- Color coding: Blue for ENTER, Orange for EXIT

### 3. New Test Function

**File:** `functions/index.js` - `testvehiclestatusnotification`

Added a dedicated Cloud Function for testing vehicle status notifications:

```javascript
exports.testvehiclestatusnotification = onCall(/* ... */);
```

**Usage:**

```javascript
// Call from client app or Firebase console
firebase.functions().httpsCallable("testvehiclestatusnotification")({
  deviceId: "TEST_DEVICE",
  action: "on", // or 'off'
});
```

### 4. Comprehensive Test Script

**File:** `test_notifications.js`

Created a Node.js test script to verify both notification types:

```bash
node test_notifications.js <userId> [deviceId]
```

## üé® NOTIFICATION FEATURES

### Vehicle Status Notifications:

- **Title:** "Vehicle Status Update"
- **Body:** "{VehicleName} ({DeviceName}) has been successfully {turned on/off}."
- **Color:** Green (#4CAF50) for ON, Red (#F44336) for OFF
- **Channel:** `vehicle_status_channel`
- **Type:** `vehicle_status`

### Geofence Notifications:

- **Title:** "Geofence Alert"
- **Body:** "{DeviceName} has {entered/exited} {GeofenceName}"
- **Color:** Blue (#2196F3) for ENTER, Orange (#FF9800) for EXIT
- **Channel:** `geofence_alerts_channel`
- **Type:** `geofence_alert`

## üîß HOW IT WORKS

### 1. Vehicle Status Change Detection:

```
Relay Status Change ‚Üí vehiclestatusmonitor ‚Üí sendVehicleStatusNotification ‚Üí FCM + Database
```

### 2. FCM Message Structure:

- **notification:** Shows in phone notification tray
- **data:** Available for in-app handling
- **android:** Android-specific styling and behavior
- **apns:** iOS-specific styling and behavior

### 3. Notification Channels:

- **vehicle_status_channel:** For vehicle on/off notifications
- **geofence_alerts_channel:** For geofence entry/exit notifications

## üì± PHONE NOTIFICATION APPEARANCE

### Vehicle Status ON:

```
üîî Vehicle Status Update
   Beat (BOA7322B2EC4) has been successfully turned on.
   [Green notification with sound/vibration]
```

### Vehicle Status OFF:

```
üîî Vehicle Status Update
   Beat (BOA7322B2EC4) has been successfully turned off.
   [Red notification with sound/vibration]
```

### Geofence Entry:

```
üîî Geofence Alert
   BOA7322B2EC4 has entered Home Geofence
   [Blue notification with sound/vibration]
```

## üß™ TESTING

### 1. Using Cloud Function:

```javascript
// Test vehicle status notification
firebase.functions().httpsCallable("testvehiclestatusnotification")({
  deviceId: "BOA7322B2EC4",
  action: "on",
});

// Test geofence notification
firebase.functions().httpsCallable("testfcmnotification")();
```

### 2. Using Test Script:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install firebase-admin

# Run test script
node test_notifications.js YOUR_USER_ID TEST_DEVICE
```

### 3. Real Vehicle Status:

- Turn vehicle relay ON/OFF via your app
- Should automatically trigger FCM notification
- Check phone notification tray

## üîç TROUBLESHOOTING

### If notifications don't appear:

1. **Check FCM tokens:** Ensure user has valid FCM tokens
2. **Check notification channels:** App should create notification channels
3. **Check device permissions:** Ensure notifications are enabled
4. **Check Firebase console:** Monitor message delivery status
5. **Check cooldown:** Vehicle status has 1-minute cooldown between notifications

### Debug logs to monitor:

```
üîî [VEHICLE_NOTIFICATION] Preparing notification
üì§ [VEHICLE_NOTIFICATION] Sent to token
‚úÖ [VEHICLE_NOTIFICATION] Sent to X/Y tokens
```

## üìä NOTIFICATION DATA STRUCTURE

Both notification types store complete data in Firestore for in-app display:

### Vehicle Status:

```javascript
{
  ownerId: "user123",
  deviceId: "device456",
  deviceName: "BOA7322B2EC4",
  vehicleName: "Beat",
  relayStatus: true,
  statusText: "on",
  actionText: "turned on",
  message: "Beat (BOA7322B2EC4) has been successfully turned on.",
  type: "vehicle_status",
  timestamp: ServerTimestamp,
  read: false
}
```

### Geofence Alert:

```javascript
{
  ownerId: "user123",
  deviceId: "device456",
  deviceName: "BOA7322B2EC4",
  geofenceName: "Home Geofence",
  action: "enter",
  message: "BOA7322B2EC4 has entered Home Geofence",
  location: { latitude: -6.2088, longitude: 106.8456 },
  type: "geofence_alert",
  timestamp: ServerTimestamp,
  read: false
}
```

## ‚úÖ EXPECTED BEHAVIOR

1. **Vehicle turned ON:** User receives green notification with sound/vibration
2. **Vehicle turned OFF:** User receives red notification with sound/vibration
3. **Notifications appear:** Both in phone notification tray AND in-app
4. **Filtering works:** App can filter by "Vehicle Status" type
5. **Cooldown respected:** Max 1 notification per minute per device

The implementation is now complete and should work exactly like geofence notifications!
