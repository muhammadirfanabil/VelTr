# ✅ GPS App Fixes - Manual Testing Checklist

## 🎯 TESTING OBJECTIVES

Test the two critical fixes:

1. **Cascade Delete Fix** - Device deletion cleans up vehicle references
2. **Device Assignment Fix** - Dropdown doesn't immediately assign devices

---

## 📋 PRE-TESTING CHECKLIST

- [ ] App is running on emulator/device
- [ ] Firebase Console is open in browser
- [ ] Can see both devices and vehicles collections in Firestore
- [ ] Have test data ready (devices with assigned vehicles)

---

## 🧪 TEST 1: CASCADE DELETE FIX

### Setup

- [ ] Navigate to Vehicle Management screen
- [ ] Identify vehicles currently assigned to devices
- [ ] Note down: Vehicle X is assigned to Device Y

### Execute Test

- [ ] Go to Device Management screen
- [ ] Find Device Y (that has vehicles assigned)
- [ ] Delete Device Y
- [ ] Confirm deletion successful (no crashes)

### Verify Results

- [ ] Return to Vehicle Management screen
- [ ] Check Vehicle X that was assigned to Device Y
- [ ] **PASS:** Vehicle X now shows "No device assigned" or similar
- [ ] **FAIL:** Vehicle X still shows Device Y (deleted device)
- [ ] **FAIL:** App crashed during deletion
- [ ] Check Firebase Console: Device Y should be gone from devices collection
- [ ] Check Firebase Console: Vehicle X should have deviceId: null

**Result: PASS / FAIL** ****\_\_\_****

---

## 🧪 TEST 2: DEVICE ASSIGNMENT FIX

### Setup

- [ ] Navigate to Vehicle Management screen
- [ ] Find a vehicle with no device assigned (or assign one temporarily)
- [ ] Click Edit/Manage for this vehicle

### Execute Test Part A (Test No Immediate Assignment)

- [ ] Open device assignment dropdown
- [ ] Select a device from dropdown
- [ ] **DO NOT PRESS UPDATE**
- [ ] Navigate away or cancel the edit
- [ ] Return to vehicle list

### Verify Part A

- [ ] **PASS:** Vehicle still shows no device assigned (selection not saved)
- [ ] **FAIL:** Vehicle immediately got assigned to selected device

### Execute Test Part B (Test Proper Assignment)

- [ ] Edit the same vehicle again
- [ ] Select a device from dropdown
- [ ] Press "Update" button
- [ ] Confirm the update

### Verify Part B

- [ ] **PASS:** Vehicle now shows assigned to selected device
- [ ] **FAIL:** Assignment didn't save after pressing update
- [ ] Check Firebase Console: Vehicle should have correct deviceId

**Result: PASS / FAIL** ****\_\_\_****

---

## 🔍 ADDITIONAL VERIFICATION

### Edge Case Tests

- [ ] Delete device with multiple vehicles assigned
- [ ] Reassign vehicle from Device A to Device B
- [ ] Check dropdown filtering (assigned devices disabled)
- [ ] Test with vehicle already assigned to another device

### Console Monitoring

- [ ] No assertion errors in debug console
- [ ] No crashes during any operations
- [ ] Firebase operations complete successfully

---

## 🚨 FAILURE INDICATORS

If you see any of these, report immediately:

- ❌ App crashes when deleting devices
- ❌ "Assertion failed" errors in console
- ❌ Vehicles still show deleted device names
- ❌ Immediate assignment on dropdown selection
- ❌ Update button doesn't save assignments
- ❌ Orphaned data in Firebase

---

## ✅ SUCCESS CRITERIA

Both tests should show:

- ✅ Device deletion removes all references
- ✅ No crashes or assertion errors
- ✅ Dropdown selection waits for update button
- ✅ Firebase data remains consistent
- ✅ UI behaves as expected
