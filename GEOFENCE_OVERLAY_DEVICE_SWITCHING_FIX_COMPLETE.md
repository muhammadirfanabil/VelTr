# Geofence Overlay Device Switching Fix - COMPLETE

## Issue Identified
When switching between devices, previously loaded geofences persisted on the map instead of being cleared and replaced with geofences for the new device.

### Symptoms
- Device A: Shows 3 geofences correctly
- Switch to Device B (0 geofences): Still shows Device A's 3 geofences
- Switch to Device C (1 geofence): Still shows Device A's 3 geofences instead of Device C's 1

## Root Cause Analysis
The device switching logic had two problems:

1. **Incorrect Device ID Usage**: `_handleDeviceSwitch()` used `widget.deviceId` (original device) instead of the new vehicle ID
2. **Incomplete Clearing**: Geofences were cleared from state but the overlay visibility wasn't properly reset

## Fix Applied

### 1. New Vehicle-Specific Device Switching (`lib/screens/Maps/mapView.dart`)

**Added new method:**
```dart
Future<void> _handleDeviceSwitchToVehicle(String newVehicleId)
```
- Properly clears geofence state
- Loads geofences for the **new** vehicle ID (not the old widget.deviceId)
- Resets overlay visibility to disabled by default

**Added new method:**
```dart
Future<void> _loadGeofenceOverlayDataForVehicle(String vehicleId)
```
- Loads geofences specifically for the given vehicle ID
- Uses both new service method and fallback stream method
- Includes proper error handling and debug logging

### 2. Enhanced Geofence Clearing
**Improved `_clearGeofencesCompletely()`:**
- Clears geofence data from state
- Hides the overlay (`showGeofences = false`)
- Cancels any existing listeners
- Forces UI rebuild to clear map overlays

### 3. Enhanced Debug Logging
**Added comprehensive rendering logs:**
- Logs when geofences are being rendered vs not rendered
- Distinguishes between "overlay disabled" vs "no geofences available"
- Tracks device switching and geofence loading operations

## Implementation Details

### Vehicle Switching Flow (Fixed):
1. **Clear Previous State**: Cancel listeners, clear geofences, hide overlay
2. **Update Device IDs**: Set `currentDeviceId` for GPS, use `vehicleId` for geofences
3. **Initialize GPS**: Set up new GPS listener for the new device
4. **Load Geofences**: Query Firestore for geofences belonging to the **new** vehicle
5. **Update UI**: Render only the new device's geofences

### Debug Log Pattern:
```
üîÑ Vehicle switch from oldDevice to newVehicleId
üßπ [MAP_OVERLAY] Clearing geofences completely for device switch
üîÑ [MAP_OVERLAY_SIMPLE] Handling device switch to vehicle: newVehicleId
üì• [MAP_OVERLAY_SIMPLE] Loading geofence data for vehicle: newVehicleId
üó∫Ô∏è [GEOFENCE_RENDER] Overlay disabled and no geofences available (during transition)
üìä [MAP_OVERLAY_SIMPLE] Successfully loaded X geofences for vehicle newVehicleId
üó∫Ô∏è Rendering geofence: GeofenceName with Y points (when overlay enabled)
```

## Expected Behavior (Fixed)

### Device Switching:
1. **Switch to Device A**: Shows only Device A's geofences
2. **Switch to Device B**: Clears Device A's geofences, shows only Device B's geofences
3. **Switch to Device C**: Clears Device B's geofences, shows only Device C's geofences

### Overlay State:
- **Default**: Overlay disabled after device switch (user must manually enable)
- **Empty Devices**: Shows "no geofences" message when overlay enabled but device has no geofences
- **Data Isolation**: Each device's geofences are completely separate

## Files Modified
1. **`lib/screens/Maps/mapView.dart`**:
   - Enhanced `_switchToVehicle()` method
   - Added `_handleDeviceSwitchToVehicle()` method
   - Added `_loadGeofenceOverlayDataForVehicle()` method
   - Improved `_clearGeofencesCompletely()` method
   - Enhanced geofence rendering debug logs

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Switch between devices and verify geofences clear properly
- [ ] Verify only current device's geofences are shown
- [ ] Confirm overlay defaults to disabled after device switch
- [ ] Test device switching with 0, 1, and multiple geofences
- [ ] Verify GPS tracking continues working during device switches
- [ ] Check debug logs show proper clearing and loading sequence

This fix ensures complete data isolation between devices and proper cleanup during device switching operations.
