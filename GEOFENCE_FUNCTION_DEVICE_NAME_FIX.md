# Geofence Function Update - Device Name Field Fix

## Summary

Updated the `geofencechangestatus` Cloud Function to correctly query Firestore devices by the `name` field instead of `macAddress`, based on the actual Firestore database structure.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Device Lookup Field Correction

**Before**: Querying by `macAddress` field

```javascript
.where("macAddress", "==", deviceId)
```

**After**: Querying by `name` field (matches Firestore structure)

```javascript
.where("name", "==", deviceId)
```

### 2. Field Naming Updates

- Changed `deviceMacAddress` to `deviceIdentifier` throughout the code for accuracy
- Updated console logs to reflect that we're working with device names/IDs, not MAC addresses
- Updated error messages and return values consistently

### 3. Database Structure Alignment

Based on the Firestore structure shown:

- Device document ID: `b5oXY5XlRhU27ZRQgMre`
- Device `name` field: `"B0A7322B2EC4"` (matches RTDB device key)
- The function now correctly queries by this `name` field

### 4. Updated Data Fields

All log entries and notifications now include:

- `deviceId`: Firestore document ID
- `deviceIdentifier`: Device name/identifier from RTDB path
- `deviceName`: Display name for the device

## Function Flow (Updated)

1. **GPS Update Received**: Function triggered by RTDB change at `/devices/{deviceIdentifier}/gps`
2. **Device Lookup**: Query Firestore for device where `name == deviceIdentifier`
3. **Geofence Processing**: Use Firestore device ID for geofence queries
4. **Logging & Notifications**: Include both Firestore ID and device identifier

## Testing Verification

Based on your Firestore structure:

- Device with name "B0A7322B2EC4" should be found correctly
- Geofences linked to Firestore device ID should be processed
- Notifications should be sent with proper device identification

## Deployment Status

‚úÖ **Successfully deployed** to `gps-project-a5c9a`
‚úÖ **No linting errors**
‚úÖ **Ready for testing**

## Next Steps

### Test the Function

1. Update GPS data in RTDB at `/devices/B0A7322B2EC4/gps`
2. Monitor function logs:
   ```bash
   firebase functions:log --only geofencechangestatus
   ```
3. Verify device lookup succeeds and geofence processing works

### Expected Log Output

```
üéØ [GEOFENCE] Starting status check for device: B0A7322B2EC4
üîç [DEVICE] Looking up device by name: B0A7322B2EC4
üë§ [OWNER] Device owner: ZddHh9WhGuY7iSoqKQk2dlwigFo1, Device name: B0A7322B2EC4, Device ID: B0A7322B2EC4, Firestore ID: b5oXY5XlRhU27ZRQgMre
```

The function should now correctly find your device and process geofences properly!
