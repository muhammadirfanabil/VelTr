echo "📝 Test Instructions:"
echo "   To test the vehicle status notification system:"
echo ""
echo "   1. Deploy the functions:"
echo "      firebase deploy --only functions"
echo ""
echo "   2. Test manual relay control:"
echo "      firebase functions:call testmanualrelay --data='{\"deviceId\":\"test_device\",\"action\":\"on\"}'"
echo "      firebase functions:call testmanualrelay --data='{\"deviceId\":\"test_device\",\"action\":\"off\"}'"
echo ""
echo "   3. Monitor Firebase Database for relay changes:"
echo "      Watch: /devices/test_device/relay"
echo ""
echo "   4. Check Firestore notifications collection for new entries with type: 'vehicle_status'"
echo ""
echo "   5. Verify FCM notifications are delivered to the device"

echo "🔍 Key Features Implemented:"
echo "   ✅ Relay status monitoring (/devices/{deviceId}/relay)"
echo "   ✅ Change detection (only triggers on actual status change)"
echo "   ✅ Proper device lookup by name"
echo "   ✅ Vehicle information retrieval"
echo "   ✅ Owner identification"
echo "   ✅ FCM notification sending"
echo "   ✅ Notification logging to Firestore"
echo "   ✅ Cooldown mechanism (1 minute default)"
echo "   ✅ Message format: '✅ Beat (vehicle.name) has been successfully turned on/off.'"
echo "   ✅ Client-side notification parsing and display"
echo "   ✅ UI integration with existing notification system"
echo ""

echo "📱 Client-Side Integration:"
echo "   ✅ NotificationType.vehicleStatus enum added"
echo "   ✅ Vehicle status notification factory method"
echo "   ✅ Proper icon and color scheme"
echo "   ✅ Badge text and styling"
echo "   ✅ Integration with notification service"
echo "   ✅ Vehicle filtering support"
echo ""

echo "🚀 The vehicle status notification system is ready for deployment and testing!"
echo ""
echo "⚠️  Remember to:"
echo "   - Test with real device IDs in your database"
echo "   - Verify FCM tokens are properly set up"
echo "   - Check Firebase Realtime Database rules allow writes to /devices/{deviceId}/relay"
echo "   - Ensure Firestore security rules allow reads/writes to notifications collection"
