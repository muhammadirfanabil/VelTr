echo "üîç GPS App Fix Verification Checklist"
echo "======================================"

echo ""
echo "üìã Manual Testing Checklist:"
echo "----------------------------"

echo "‚úÖ 1. App Startup GPS Loading"
echo "   - Launch the app"
echo "   - Verify GPS data loads on the map screen"
echo "   - Check for 'GPS Not Available' errors"
echo ""

echo "‚úÖ 2. Vehicle Selection and Switching"
echo "   - Tap the vehicle selector (blue chip at bottom)"
echo "   - Verify vehicle list shows with blue circle indicators"
echo "   - Switch to a different vehicle"
echo "   - Verify GPS data loads for new vehicle"
echo "   - No 'GPS Not Available' errors should appear"
echo ""

echo "‚úÖ 3. Retry Button Functionality"
echo "   - If GPS data is not available, tap 'Retry'"
echo "   - Verify the retry button actually reloads GPS data"
echo "   - Check for successful GPS data retrieval"
echo ""

echo "‚úÖ 4. Real-time GPS Updates"
echo "   - Keep the app open with GPS data displayed"
echo "   - Verify GPS coordinates update in real-time"
echo "   - Check timestamp updates"
echo ""

echo "‚úÖ 5. Device Switching Stress Test"
echo "   - Switch between vehicles multiple times"
echo "   - Verify no memory leaks or app crashes"
echo "   - Each switch should load GPS data successfully"
echo ""

echo "‚úÖ 6. Offline Device Handling"
echo "   - Try switching to a vehicle with offline device"
echo "   - Verify proper error handling and user feedback"
echo ""

echo ""
echo "üîß Debug Commands for Verification:"
echo "-----------------------------------"

echo "# Check GPS listener setup in logs:"
echo "adb logcat | grep \"Setting up GPS listener\""
echo ""

echo "# Check vehicle switching in logs:"
echo "adb logcat | grep \"Switched to device name\""
echo ""

echo "# Check device initialization in logs:"
echo "adb logcat | grep \"Initialized with device\""
echo ""

echo "# Check for Firebase listener errors:"
echo "adb logcat | grep \"Firebase.*listener.*error\""
echo ""

echo ""
echo "üèóÔ∏è Code Structure Verification:"
echo "------------------------------"

echo "‚úÖ StreamSubscription Management:"
echo "   - _gpsListener field exists"
echo "   - _relayListener field exists" 
echo "   - _vehicleListener field exists"
echo ""

echo "‚úÖ Listener Methods Enhanced:"
echo "   - _listenToGPSData() cancels existing before creating new"
echo "   - _listenToRelayStatus() cancels existing before creating new"
echo ""

echo "‚úÖ Device ID Resolution:"
echo "   - _initializeDeviceId() method exists"
echo "   - getDeviceNameById() used for Firestore ID ‚Üí MAC conversion"
echo ""

echo "‚úÖ Vehicle Selection Logic:"
echo "   - _isVehicleSelected() helper method exists"
echo "   - FutureBuilder properly implemented"
echo "   - No duplicated code in vehicle selector"
echo ""

echo "‚úÖ Memory Management:"
echo "   - dispose() method cancels all listeners"
echo "   - Proper cleanup on widget disposal"
echo ""

echo ""
echo "üéØ Expected Behavior After Fixes:"
echo "--------------------------------"

echo "BEFORE (Broken):"
echo "‚ùå GPS shows 'Not Available' when switching devices"
echo "‚ùå Retry button doesn't work"
echo "‚ùå Firebase listeners pile up causing memory leaks"
echo "‚ùå Device ID inconsistency between Firestore and FRDB"
echo ""

echo "AFTER (Fixed):"
echo "‚úÖ GPS data loads correctly when switching devices"
echo "‚úÖ Retry button restores GPS functionality"
echo "‚úÖ Proper listener management prevents memory leaks"
echo "‚úÖ Device ID resolution works correctly for FRDB queries"
echo "‚úÖ Vehicle selection shows correct blue circle indicators"
echo "‚úÖ Real-time GPS updates work seamlessly"
echo ""

echo ""
echo "üö® Red Flags to Watch For:"
echo "--------------------------"
echo "‚ùå 'GPS Not Available' dialogs appearing frequently"
echo "‚ùå App becoming slow after multiple device switches"
echo "‚ùå Firebase connection errors in logs"
echo "‚ùå Vehicle selector showing wrong selected vehicle"
echo "‚ùå GPS coordinates not updating in real-time"
echo "‚ùå Retry button showing 'Still no GPS data available'"
echo ""

echo ""
echo "‚ú® Success Indicators:"
echo "---------------------"
echo "‚úÖ Smooth vehicle switching without GPS interruption"
echo "‚úÖ Blue circle correctly indicates selected vehicle"
echo "‚úÖ GPS data refreshes properly with retry button"
echo "‚úÖ Real-time coordinates update continuously"
echo "‚úÖ No memory-related slowdowns during extended use"
echo "‚úÖ Proper error handling for offline devices"
echo ""

echo ""
echo "üìä Performance Metrics to Monitor:"
echo "---------------------------------"
echo "‚Ä¢ App startup time to GPS data display"
echo "‚Ä¢ Vehicle switch response time"
echo "‚Ä¢ Memory usage during extended use"
echo "‚Ä¢ Firebase listener count (should stay constant)"
echo "‚Ä¢ GPS update frequency and accuracy"
echo ""

echo ""
echo "üîÑ Testing Cycle:"
echo "----------------"
echo "1. Launch app ‚Üí Check GPS loads"
echo "2. Switch vehicle ‚Üí Check GPS loads for new device"
echo "3. Test retry button ‚Üí Check GPS restoration"
echo "4. Multiple switches ‚Üí Check stability"
echo "5. Leave app running ‚Üí Check real-time updates"
echo "6. Background/foreground ‚Üí Check reconnection"
