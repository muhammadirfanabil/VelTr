# Run this before and after testing to verify the fixes

echo "üîç STEP 1: Check Firebase Console"
echo "Open Firebase Console and navigate to your project"
echo "Go to Firestore Database"
echo ""

echo "üìä STEP 2: Document Current State"
echo "Before testing, document the current data:"
echo ""
echo "Devices Collection:"
echo "- Note device IDs and names"
echo "- Example: dev001, dev002, dev003"
echo ""
echo "Vehicles Collection:"
echo "- Note which vehicles have deviceId assigned"
echo "- Example: vehicle001 -> deviceId: 'dev001'"
echo "          vehicle002 -> deviceId: 'dev001'"
echo "          vehicle003 -> deviceId: null"
echo ""

echo "üß™ STEP 3: Test Cascade Delete"
echo "1. Pick a device that has vehicles assigned (e.g., dev001)"
echo "2. In the app, delete this device"
echo "3. Return to Firebase Console and refresh"
echo "4. VERIFY: Vehicles that had deviceId: 'dev001' now have deviceId: null"
echo ""

echo "‚úÖ Expected Results:"
echo "- Device collection: dev001 should be gone"
echo "- Vehicles collection: deviceId fields should be null where they were dev001"
echo "- No broken references or orphaned data"
echo ""

echo "üß™ STEP 4: Test Device Assignment Dropdown"
echo "1. Edit a vehicle in the app"
echo "2. Select a device from dropdown (don't press update)"
echo "3. Navigate away/cancel"
echo "4. VERIFY: Assignment should NOT have been saved"
echo "5. Edit again, select device, press UPDATE"
echo "6. VERIFY: Assignment should now be saved"

echo "üîß STEP 5: Firebase Console Queries"
echo "Run these queries in Firebase Console to verify:"
echo ""
echo "Find vehicles with specific device:"
echo "vehicles.where('deviceId', '==', 'DEVICE_ID')"
echo ""
echo "Find vehicles with null deviceId:"
echo "vehicles.where('deviceId', '==', null)"
echo ""
echo "Count total vehicles:"
echo "vehicles.count()"
echo ""
echo "Count total devices:"

echo "üêõ STEP 6: Check for Issues"
echo "If you see any of these, the fix failed:"
echo "‚ùå Vehicles still reference deleted device IDs"
echo "‚ùå App crashes when deleting devices"
echo "‚ùå Assertion errors in console"
echo "‚ùå Immediate assignment on dropdown selection"
echo "‚ùå Orphaned data in Firebase"
echo ""

echo "‚úÖ STEP 7: Success Indicators"
echo "‚úÖ Device deletion removes device from devices collection"
echo "‚úÖ Vehicle deviceId fields are nullified when device is deleted"
echo "‚úÖ Dropdown selection doesn't immediately save"
echo "‚úÖ Update button properly saves assignments"
echo "‚úÖ No console errors or crashes"
echo "‚úÖ All data remains consistent in Firebase"
