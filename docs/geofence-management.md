## Data Flow

### 1. Geofence Creation Flow

1. **User Navigation**: User selects device and navigates to Add Geofence screen
2. **Location Loading**: System loads user's current location and device GPS position
3. **Map Initialization**: Map centers on user/device location with appropriate zoom level
4. **Polygon Creation**: User taps map to create polygon points (minimum 3 required)
5. **Visual Feedback**: Real-time polygon preview with numbered point markers
6. **Validation**: System validates polygon geometry and point count
7. **Save Operation**: Geofence saved to Firebase with device association
8. **Navigation**: User redirected to device geofence list

### 2. Geofence Monitoring Flow

1. **Device Location Stream**: Real-time GPS data from Firebase Realtime Database
2. **Boundary Detection**: Continuous point-in-polygon calculations
3. **State Changes**: Enter/Exit event detection with timestamp logging
4. **Alert Generation**: Notification creation for boundary violations
5. **Status Updates**: UI updates with current device status (inside/outside)

### 3. Geofence Editing Flow

1. **Geofence Selection**: User selects existing geofence from device list
2. **Data Loading**: System loads existing polygon points and metadata
3. **Map Rendering**: Visual representation with editable polygon points
4. **Modification**: User can add/remove/move polygon points
5. **Real-time Preview**: Live polygon updates during editing
6. **Save/Cancel**: Modified geofence saved or changes discarded

## API/Service Reference

### GeofenceService Methods

```dart
// Create new geofence
Future<String?> createGeofence(Geofence geofence, String deviceId)

// Update existing geofence
Future<bool> updateGeofence(Geofence geofence)

// Delete geofence
Future<bool> deleteGeofence(String geofenceId)

// Get geofences for device
Future<List<Geofence>> getGeofencesForDevice(String deviceId)

// Get single geofence
Future<Geofence?> getGeofence(String geofenceId)
```

### Map Markers Service Methods

```dart
// User location marker (blue dot)
static MarkerLayer createUserLocationMarker(LatLng userLocation, {double size = 20.0})

// Device location marker (GPS icon)
static MarkerLayer createDeviceLocationMarker(
  LatLng deviceLocation,
  {bool isLoading = false, String? deviceName, double size = 40.0}
)

// Polygon point markers (numbered)
static MarkerLayer createPolygonPointMarkers(
  List<LatLng> polygonPoints,
  {Color? color, double size = 40.0}
)
```

### Geofence Alert Service Methods

```dart
// Start monitoring device
void startMonitoring(String deviceId)

// Stop monitoring device
void stopMonitoring(String deviceId)

// Get alert history
Future<List<GeofenceAlert>> getAlertHistory(String deviceId)
```

## UI Behavior

### Add Geofence Screen

- **Map Interaction**: Tap to add polygon points, double-tap to complete
- **Visual Feedback**: Numbered markers, real-time polygon preview
- **Validation**: Minimum 3 points required, visual point counter
- **Location Markers**: User location (blue dot) and device location (GPS icon)
- **Action Buttons**: Undo last point, reset all points, save geofence

### Edit Geofence Screen

- **Existing Data**: Loads and displays current geofence polygon
- **Modification**: Add new points by tapping, drag existing points to move
- **Visual Consistency**: Same marker styles as Add Geofence screen
- **Save/Cancel**: Modified geofence can be saved or changes discarded

### Device Geofence List

- **Geofence Cards**: Visual list with name, status, and last activity
- **Status Indicators**: Inside/Outside status with color coding
- **Actions**: Edit, delete, view details for each geofence
- **Real-time Updates**: Live status updates as device moves

### Geofence Alerts

- **Alert History**: Chronological list of enter/exit events
- **Filtering**: Filter by date range, alert type, geofence
- **Notifications**: Push notifications for real-time alerts

## Technical Implementation Details

### Map Layer Ordering (Z-Index)

1. **Tile Layer** - Base map tiles (bottom)
2. **Polyline Layer** - Geofence outline
3. **Polygon Layer** - Geofence fill area
4. **Polygon Point Markers** - Numbered edit points
5. **Device Location Marker** - GPS icon
6. **User Location Marker** - Blue dot (top)

### Real-time Location Processing
