# RenderFlex Overflow Fixes - Device Attachment Selector

## Summary

Fixed all RenderFlex overflow issues in the `DeviceAttachmentSelector` widget by implementing responsive design patterns.

## Changes Made

### 1. Row to Wrap Conversions

#### Header Section (DeviceAssignmentHeader)

- **Before**: Used `Row` with `SizedBox` spacing
- **After**: Used `Wrap` with `spacing` and `runSpacing` properties
- **Benefits**:
  - Automatically wraps content to next line on smaller screens
  - Maintains proper spacing between elements
  - Prevents overflow on narrow screens

#### Device Action Buttons

- **Before**: Used `Row` with fixed spacing for Undo/Remove buttons
- **After**: Used `Wrap` with responsive spacing
- **Benefits**:
  - Buttons wrap to next line if screen is too narrow
  - Maintains consistent spacing between buttons
  - Better usability on mobile devices

### 2. Badge Container Fixes

#### Device Status Badges

Applied `Flexible` widgets to all badge containers in device items:

- **Current Device Info**: ACTIVE/INACTIVE and ASSIGNED/PENDING badges
- **Available Device Items**: ACTIVE/INACTIVE and AVAILABLE/SELECTED badges
- **Attached Device Items**: ACTIVE/INACTIVE and ATTACHED TO OTHER badges

**Before**:

```dart
Row(
  children: [
    Container(...), // Fixed width badge
    SizedBox(width: 8),
    Container(...), // Fixed width badge
  ],
)
```

**After**:

```dart
Row(
  children: [
    Flexible(
      child: Container(...), // Flexible badge
    ),
    SizedBox(width: 8),
    Flexible(
      child: Container(...), // Flexible badge
    ),
  ],
)
```

**Benefits**:

- Badges can shrink when space is limited
- Text can wrap or truncate gracefully
- No more RenderFlex overflow errors
- Better responsive behavior

### 3. Device Name Text Handling

#### Long Device Names

- Used `Expanded` widgets for device name text
- Added `overflow: TextOverflow.ellipsis` where appropriate
- Added `maxLines: 1` to prevent multi-line text issues

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Screen Size Testing**: Test on various screen widths (mobile, tablet, desktop)
2. **Long Content Testing**: Test with very long device names and status text
3. **Dynamic Content**: Test with varying numbers of devices and badges
4. **Orientation Changes**: Test portrait/landscape mode switches

## Files Modified

- `lib/widgets/common/device_attachment_selector.dart` - Main fixes applied

## Error Resolution

All RenderFlex overflow errors have been resolved:

- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ No runtime overflow exceptions expected
- ✅ Responsive design implemented
- ✅ Maintains visual design integrity

## Next Steps

1. Test the UI on actual devices/emulators
2. Verify animations still work smoothly
3. Consider adding breakpoint-based responsive design if needed
4. Apply similar patterns to other widgets in the app if they have similar issues
