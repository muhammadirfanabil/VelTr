# Google Authentication Registration Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **AuthService.registerGoogleUser Method**

**Problem**: The method was calling `GoogleSignIn().signIn()` again even when the user was already signed in, causing authentication conflicts.

**Solution**:

- Check if there's a current Google user first using `googleSignIn.currentUser`
- If user is already signed in, use existing credentials
- Only call `signIn()` if no current user exists
- Properly handle Firebase re-authentication when needed

### 2. **Login Screen Google Authentication Flow**

**Problem**: When handling "not_registered" exception, the code was calling `GoogleSignIn().signIn()` again, which could cause the user to go through the sign-in flow twice.

**Solution**:

- Use `googleSignIn.currentUser` to get the already signed-in user's information
- Pass existing user data to the registration screen
- Add proper error handling for cases where current user is null

### 3. **RegisterOne Screen Google Signup**

**Problem**: The Google signup button always navigated to the registration screen, even for already registered users.

**Solution**:

- First attempt to login with Google using `AuthService.loginWithGoogle()`
- If login succeeds, navigate directly to home
- Only navigate to registration screen if "not_registered" error occurs
- Improved error handling and user feedback

### 4. **GoogleSignupScreen Registration Logic**

**Problem**: The screen didn't check if the user was already registered before attempting registration.

**Solution**:

- Check if user is already registered by attempting login first
- If already registered, show appropriate message and navigate to home
- Only proceed with registration if user is truly not registered
- Better error handling and user experience

## Key Improvements

1. **Eliminated Duplicate Sign-in Calls**: Users no longer go through Google sign-in multiple times
2. **Better User Experience**: Existing users are recognized and logged in directly
3. **Robust Error Handling**: Proper handling of various authentication states
4. **Consistent Flow**: Streamlined authentication flow from registration to login

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New User Registration via Google

1. User clicks "Sign in with Google" on RegisterOne screen
2. Google sign-in flow completes
3. System detects user is not registered
4. User is taken to GoogleSignupScreen to complete profile
5. Registration completes and user is logged in

### Scenario 2: Existing User Login via Google

1. User clicks "Sign in with Google" on RegisterOne screen
2. Google sign-in flow completes
3. System detects user is already registered
4. User is logged in directly to home screen

### Scenario 3: Login Screen Google Authentication

1. User clicks "Login with Google" on login screen
2. If registered: Direct login to home
3. If not registered: Navigate to GoogleSignupScreen with user info
